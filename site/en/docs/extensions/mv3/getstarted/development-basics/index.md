## Overview {: #overview }

This page describes the process of developing an extension. We will create a demo extension, load it locally and share tips that will help improve your chrome extension development experience. 

## Building the extension {: #build }

Let‚Äôs create a ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù extension. It displays a ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù heading on an extension popup.

If you prefer, you can download the files on Github.

Create a directory to store the extension files. Next, add a file called `manifest.json` and include the following code:

{% Label %}manifest.js:{% endLabel %}

```json
{
 "name": "Hello Extensions",
 "description": "Base Level Extension",
 "version": "1.0",
 "manifest_version": 3
}
```

Every extension requires a manifest; above, we defined the extension‚Äôs metadata. This extension will only have a popup. Let‚Äôs declare it under the [action][api-action] key:

{% Label %}manifest.js:{% endLabel %}

```json
{
 ...
 "action": {
   "default_popup": "hello.html"
 }
}
```

Create a file titled `hello.html`, and add the following code:

{% Label %}hello.html{% endLabel %}

``` html
<html>
 <body>
   <h1>Hello Extensions</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

The extension now displays `hello.html` when the extension action is clicked. Let‚Äôs test it on Chrome by loading it locally.

## Loading your unpacked extension {: #load-unpacked }

To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
    * Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
    * Or, click on the Chrome menu, hovering over **More Tools,** then select **Extensions**.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.

Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.


## Pinning your extension {: #pin }

By default, when you load your extension locally, it will appear in the extensions menu (the puzzle piece). To access your extension quickly during development, pin your extension to the toolbar.

Now when you click on the extension‚Äôs action (toolbar icon), you should see a popup.

## Reloading your extension {: #reload }

Let‚Äôs go back to the code and change the `H1` element in your HTML file.

{% Label %}hello.html{% endLabel %}

```html
<html>
 <body>
   <h1>Hello Extensions of the world! üëã</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

After saving the file, go to the extension management page. You can see your changes made by clicking on the refresh icon next to the **on/off** toggle:

Remember every time you make any changes, refresh your extension!

## Finding console and error logs {: #logs}

During development, you may want to debug your scripts by accessing the browser console logs. Let‚Äôs start by adding a script tag to the hello.html.

{% Label %}hello.html{% endLabel %}

```html
<html>
 <head>
 <script src="popup.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
   <h1>Hello Extensions of the world</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

Create a `popup.js` file and add a console.log():

{% Label %}popup.js{% endLabel %}

```js
console.log("This is a popup!")
```

Refresh the extension. Open the popup and right-click to inspect the popup. You should see the log.

## Structuring your project {: #structure }

There are many ways to structure an extension project, however, you should always place the manifest.json file in the root of the project. Here‚Äôs a structure example:


```text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my extension/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jquery-min.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.css
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-16.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-32.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-48.png
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-128.png
```

## Using Typescript {: #types }

If you are developing using an [IDE][mdn-ide] like VSCode, Atom, Sublime, etc... you can use the npm package [chrome-types][npm-chrome-types] to take advantage of autocompletion for the [Chrome API][doc-apis]. This npm package is published automatically and is updated when the Chromium source changes.

Make sure you upgrade this npm package to the latest version frequently.
